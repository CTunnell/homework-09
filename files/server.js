/*
The application should have a db.json file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

The following API routes should be created:

GET /api/notes - Should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.

POST /api/notes - Should recieve a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client.

DELETE /api/notes/:id - Should recieve a query paramter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.

// The below points our server to a series of "route" files.
// These routes give our server a "map" of how to respond when users visit or request data from various URLs.
